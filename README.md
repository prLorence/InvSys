# InvSys

An Inventory Management System that uses Vertical Slice Architecture.

# Purpose

I developed a minimal  Car Sales API using Onion Layer Architecture from Clean Architecture and I saw some problems with it:
1. File changes are reflected across all layers.
2. Learning the codebase requires more file/folder hopping than needed.

So, the pupose of this project is try Vertical Slice Architecture and build my intuition from there.
